Some notes on the discrete Fourier transform and FFTW's implementation:

We are ignoring the advice of Numerical Recipes p505 (2nd ed, or p610 3rd ed):
"in fact, we categorically recommend that you _only_ use FFTs with N a power of
two. If the length of your data set is not a power of two pad it with zeros up
to the next power of two." But at some point, Randy requested to replace
padding with not padding. ?? Plus, fftw has its whole "plan" phase, so
arbitrary N shouldn't be SO bad.

Because we are calculating the power spectral density, we should do some
windowing to prevent excessive leakage. basically, multiply each number by some
scaling factor that is ~0 at the edges and ~unity in the middle. we do this b/c
we see a snapshot of the entire data stream and there is considerable spectral
leakage from one bin to the next. because at the left and right, we have only
the tailing or leading bins to look at, we do not get a complete picture of
where they came from. so, instead, we hardly look at those points, where the
information is incomplete and look more at the middle points where we know both
trailing and leading edges. windowing methods accomplish this. see numerical
recipes p553

If you put in N real numbers into a DFT, you get out N/2+1 complex numbers
The FFTW convention "Half Complex" is a way of packing these into a
length-N vector exactly.

Let's say we have N complex numbers where the kth number is composed of real
imaginary parts R(k) + I(k) instead of having an array of complex numbers with
length n, we construct an array of length n in the following order: R[0], R[1],
R[2], ...,R[N/2], I[ ((N+1)/2)-1 ], ..., I[2], I[1] Because of symmetry for
even N, the 0th elements and the Nyquist element have no imaginary part and are
therefore omitted in the second half of the array. If N is odd, the Nyquist
frequency lies between indicies and the highest I[] is included. The result for
either even or odd N: the input and output arrays are the same length.

     Note from Randy:
     Be sure that you are averaging the SQUARED signals (V2/Hz) and then displaying
     the sqrt of that average.  If you, instead, just average the V/sqrt(Hz) signal,
     you will be off by an insidiously small gain factor, something like 8%,
     depending on the f binning!  This was a hard-won bug removal in some of my
     code ~3 years ago.

     Take our normalized v/root(hz) function and square it (v^2/hz).  Use the power spectrum to
     compute the average power. when it comes time to plot it (v/root(hz)) take the sqrt
     of the average.
